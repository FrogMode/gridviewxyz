**Subject:** API/Data Access Inquiry for Motorsport Aggregator Project

Hello,

I'm building GridView (gridview.xyz), a motorsport data aggregator that aims to provide fans with unified access to results, standings, and schedules across multiple racing series.

We're currently using your publicly available IMSA timing data and have been impressed with the quality and reliability of your platform.

We're interested in exploring data access options for additional series you support:

- **FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC)**
- **European Le Mans Series (ELMS)**
- **Asian Le Mans Series**
- **Formula E** (if applicable)
- **Ferrari Challenge**

**Our questions:**

1. Do you offer API access or data licensing for third-party applications?
2. What are the pricing tiers for:
   - Historical results data
   - Live timing data
   - Full API access
3. Are there different options for non-commercial/hobbyist projects vs. commercial applications?
4. Is there a developer/startup program with reduced rates?

**About our project:**
- Fan-focused aggregator, not a betting platform
- Currently covering F1, NASCAR, IndyCar, IMSA, WRC
- Goal is to be a one-stop dashboard for motorsport enthusiasts
- Open to promotional partnerships or attribution arrangements

Thank you for your time. I'd appreciate any information about data access options and pricing.

Best regards,
Grant Gerber
