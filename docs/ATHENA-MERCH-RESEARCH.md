**Athena 🦉 | Research & Strategy Report**
**Date:** February 3, 2026

## Executive Summary

For GridView (a motorsport data aggregator), I recommend **Fourthwall** as the storefront with built-in print-on-demand, or **Shopify Starter + Printful** if you want more control. Both approaches minimize startup costs and eliminate inventory risk.

**TL;DR Recommendation:**
- **Easiest path**: Fourthwall (free, handles everything)
- **More control**: Shopify Starter ($5/mo) + Printful (free tier)
- **Expected margins**: 30-50% on apparel, 50-70% on stickers/posters
- **Startup cost**: $0-$5/month

### Design Concepts for GridView

Given GridView's brand (dark theme, racing red #e10600, data-focused):

1. **"Always On The Grid"** - Minimalist text tee
2. **Track Layout Collection** - Spa, Monaco, Le Mans silhouettes
3. **Data Viz Aesthetic** - Timing screens, telemetry-inspired graphics
4. **Checkered Flag Patterns** - Subtle, premium look
5. **Series-Specific** - F1, WRC, WEC themed (careful with trademarks)
6. **Memes/Inside Jokes** - "Box Box Box", "Pronto?", "Gentlemen, a short view back to the past"
7. **GridView Logo Merch** - Simple brand building

### ⚠️ Trademark Warnings
- Cannot use official F1, WRC, NASCAR, etc. logos
- Team names/logos are trademarked
- Driver likenesses require permission
- Stick to: generic racing themes, track shapes, your own brand, parody/fair use carefully

## 5. Integration with GridView

### Option A: Subdomain Redirect (Easiest)
```
store.gridview.xyz → Fourthwall/Shopify hosted store
```
- Set up CNAME record in DNS
- Fourthwall provides custom domain free
- Shopify needs Basic plan ($29/mo) for custom domain

**Pros:** Zero code changes to main site
**Cons:** Different URL, slight brand disconnect

### Option B: Embed Store Section
```html
<!-- In gridview.xyz/store -->
<iframe src="https://gridview.fourthwall.com" />
```
- Quick to implement
- Works but feels less integrated

### Option C: Link from Navigation (Recommended Start)
```
gridview.xyz  →  [Store] button  →  gridview.fourthwall.com
```
- Add "Store" link to site navigation
- Opens in new tab
- Zero friction to implement

### Option D: Custom Integration (Future)
- Use Shopify Storefront API or Fourthwall API
- Build `/store` page with product listings
- Handle cart/checkout via redirect
- Maximum brand consistency
- Requires development time

### Brand Consistency Checklist
- [ ] Match dark theme (#0a0a0f background)
- [ ] Use racing red (#e10600) accents
- [ ] Consistent typography
- [ ] GridView logo in store header
- [ ] Matching favicon

Fourthwall and Shopify both support theme customization to match your brand colors.
