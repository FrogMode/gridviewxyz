## 🔥 Key Themes & Talking Points

### 1. **Porsche Dominance = Respect + Skepticism**
> "With a BoP like theirs, I could have won LeMans in a Honda Civic." — @PorscheFunatik

Some fans questioning Balance of Performance (BoP) giving Porsche an edge. Others pointing out 2 IMSA titles + 3 Rolex 24s speaks for itself.

### 2. **FOG Was the Great Equalizer**
Multiple articles noting fog "nullified Cadillac's advantage." Cadillac had pace but couldn't capitalize in reduced visibility. Porsche called this their **hardest of the three wins**.

### 3. **First-Lap Chaos**
> "Greatest drivers in the world, wrecking in the first corner, of the first lap, for a 24 hour race. 🤦‍♂️" — @Spidle_Scott

The start was messy. Some headshaking from fans.

### 4. **NBC/Peacock Coverage Backlash**
> "NBC: We'll show you the first hour of the Rolex 24 from Daytona... but if you want to watch the middle 22 hours you'll have to subscribe to Peacock." — @Daosauce

This tweet got traction. Fans frustrated with fragmented coverage.

### 5. **Roger Penske Wants Le Mans**
> "Quero voltar para Le Mans" — Roger Penske

Brazilian media picked this up. Penske eyeing a WEC return after IMSA dominance.

### 6. **Cars 20th Anniversary Celebration**
Porsche brought Lightning McQueen & Sally Carrera life-size replicas to celebrate Pixar's *Cars* anniversary alongside the 963 LMDh and 911 GT3 R. Fun fan engagement.

- "Hope they fix it for next year"

---

## 🎬 Interesting Storylines

1. **Endurance Iron Man:** Laurin Heinrich won Daytona, then immediately flew to Dubai for the Asian Le Mans 4H — and swept both races. Absolute machine.

2. **The Scheduling Debate:** Fans reminiscing about "Speed Weeks" when Rolex 24 → Clash → Daytona 500 flowed together. NFL schedule extension blamed for fragmenting the racing calendar.

3. **Cadillac's "What If?":** They had the car. Fog took away their window. Expect them to come back hungry at Sebring.

---

## 📌 TL;DR

**Porsche Penske is the dynasty.** Three straight Rolex 24 wins, 21 total Daytona victories. Twitter respects the achievement but some fatigue is setting in. Cadillac fans are salty about the fog. NBC's Peacock paywall drew more criticism than any on-track incident. Next up: Sebring — where Cadillac will be out for blood.
